/**
* COP 3530: Project 2 â€“ Binary Search Trees
* <p>
* Opens a country named Countries2.csv
* Formats them into a country per line, and generates a binary tree
* Each node is a country name and it's GDP.
* 
* <p>
* First it reads the countries
* Then it prints the tree it makes with the countries in order
* Deletes three countries, Australia, Czech Republic, and Norway
* Then it prints Preorder, finds Sri Lanka, North Cyprus, Czech Republic, and Norway
* Then it outputs their per capita GDP or -1 if they aren't found and how many nodes were visited to find them.
* 
* Lastly it deletes Malawi, Somalia, Canada, Tunisia, and New Zealand
* Then it prints the top and bottom ten countries in terms of GDP
*
